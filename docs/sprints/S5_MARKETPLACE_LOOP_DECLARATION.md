# Sprint S5 — Marketplace Loop Declaration

## Current State (As-Is)
- Supply creation: NOT IMPLEMENTED (in this repo)
- Demand creation: NOT IMPLEMENTED (in this repo)
- Matching: NOT IMPLEMENTED (in this repo)
- Completion: NOT IMPLEMENTED (in this repo)
- Measurement: NOT IMPLEMENTED (in this repo)

## Declaration
Sprint S5 did NOT aim to implement the marketplace loop in the pro-work repository.
Sprint S5 objective was governance stabilization:
- Execution reproducibility artifacts
- Repo classification (governance/orchestration)
- Documented constraints and evidence packaging

Marketplace loop implementation is deferred to Sprint S7 and must occur in downstream runnable repos.

## Governance Note
This is an explicit, accepted gap.
No runtime claims are made for loop completion in S5.
