# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the `main` (or `master`) branch is actively supported for security fixes unless stated otherwise in release notes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, report privately with:
- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept (if safe)
- Impact assessment (what can be accessed/modified)
- Any relevant logs or stack traces (redact secrets)

## Response Expectations
We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- Provide a mitigation plan or fix timeline once validated

## Safe Harbor
We welcome responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Do not access data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
